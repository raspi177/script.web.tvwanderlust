==General==

This programm addon for xbmc media center is a scraper for fahrplan.oebb.at. It displays Austrian train departures of fahrplan.oebb.at for a station after some 20 seconds initialisation. Editable stationname and refresh interval.

==Made with==

It is a phython script relying on script.module.mechanize and script.module.beautifulsoup. It actually uses mechanize and a slightly modified version of ElementSoup. ElementSoup itself uses ElementTree and BeautifulSoup, where ElementTree is provided in source rather than relied upon, because ElementTree of the official repository is version 1.2.7 at the time of writing, which is too old, that is, it doesn't support Xpaths for tag-attributes. 

The scaping relies strongly on the structure of the website, which can be improved for sure. Anyway, it uses mechanize to fill out 2 forms. Then ElementSoup finds the relevant tags with XPath and some regular expression cleanup functions. The Result is handled to the refresh function of the main window, which is called by a daemon periodically. While sleeping, the daemon listens to the xbmc.abortRequested signal for a clean program termination, that is it hangs otherwise. Thanks ronie for the tip.
